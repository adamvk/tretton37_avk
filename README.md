## tretton37 colleagues

This project shows all of the colleagues currently working at tretton37.<br />

## Running the website

The website is available at [http://tretton37avk.herokuapp.com](http://tretton37avk.herokuapp.com).<br />
It can also be run locally by cloning the project from GitHub, and thereafter running (from the project directory):

### `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

This command builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />

## Thoughts behind the website

My aim when making this was to create a site that is modern, yet simple and minimalistic.<br />
I decided to aim for these points:

- _design / accessibility
- [x] Fancy animations (1 pt)
- [ ] Keyboard only function (1 pt)
- [x] A modern design (1 pt)
- [ ] No UI framework used (1 pt)
- [ ] Screen reader function (1 pt)
- [x] Responsive design (2 pt)

- _functionality
- [x] Sort by name and office (1 pt)
- [x] Filter by name and office (1 pt)
- [x] Filter by contact links (1 pt)
- [x] Enable switch between a grid and a differend view (1 pt)
- [x] Available on a free public url (Heroku) (1 pt)
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline from your repo (1 pt)
- [ ] Only render a set of profiles (2 pt)
- [ ] Build your own API (4 pt)

- _testing/QA
- [x] Works in Chrome/Firefox/Edge (1 pt)
- [x] Works in IE11 (1 pt)
- [ ] End-to-end testing (2 pt)
- [ ] Unit tests (2 pt)

I first thought of not using any UI framework, as well as using by own backend, but came to the conclusion that this would take up too much time.To keep the time around 6 hours, I therefore decided to use some components from Semantic UI and Bootstrap.
